V. Scenes:  
We use four scenes in our Unity project.  The first encountered when playing the game is the "MainMenu" scene where the players first load up the game.
The second is the "BasicOfficeScene" that is the first actual level the players will get to play.
The third is the "Level2" scene, which as the name implies is the second level of the game.
The fourth and final scene is the "DoorCodeScene" which is the final minigame the players must complete in order to beat the game.
